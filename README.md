# ADIDAS-Sales--PowerBI-Dashboard
I created an interactive PowerBI dashboard to analyze Adidas's sales data and uncover insights into revenue trends, product performance, and regional sales distribution. This helped visualize business KPIs clearly and effectively.

# Key Insights & Features
•	Total Sales Performance:
•	Adidas generated $900M in total sales, showing strong overall revenue performance during the analysed period.
•	 Monthly Sales Trends:
•	Clear seasonal patterns were observed, with peak sales occurring in specific months, indicating potential promotional or product launch cycles.
•	Regional Contribution:
•	The Western region contributed the highest sales, followed by the Central and Eastern regions.
•	State-level analysis revealed key revenue hotspots, helping to identify target markets for expansion or focused marketing.
•	 Product-Level Insights:
•	A small number of products contributed disproportionately to total sales and units sold, highlighting best-performing SKUs.
•	Price and volume analysis helped detect high margin vs. high-volume product categories.
•	Retailer Performance:
•	Certain retailers consistently outperformed others in both volume and revenue, suggesting strong partnerships or better in-store execution.
•	 Operating Metrics:
•	Operating Margin stood at 42%, and the average price per unit was $45, indicating strong profitability and efficient pricing strategy.
•	 Underperforming Segments:
•	Identified product and region combinations with low sales and margins, which can be potential areas for improvement, discontinuation, or strategic re-evaluation.

# Why I Did This:
As someone exploring a deep dive into Product Management, understanding how data drives decisions are crucial. Building this dashboard gave me a strong grasp of how product performance, market segmentation, and customer trends can be visualized and analyzed to make strategic decisions.
